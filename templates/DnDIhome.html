    <p>If you don't have dice, there is a  dice roller! for any of the basic dice, plus a custom option!</p>
    <p>If you create an acount you can set favorite stat blocks, save some notes, and even your characters.</p>

    <h2>Info about this site</h2>
    <p>Some spells, monsters, classes, etc will not show up.</p>
    <p>We apologize as this data is not accessable due to the only avalible data is the free rulebook, a.k.a. the DnD SRD.</p>
    <p>This is still in development, and will not be done for a while (meant to keep me busy).</p>
